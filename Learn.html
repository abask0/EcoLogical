    <h1>Climate Change</h1>

    <div id="boxes">

<p>
The Earth is getting warmer — and it’s a big deal.
Climate change means the planet's temperature is rising over time. This happens because of something called the greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide (from cars, factories, and burning fossil fuels) trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. That extra heat causes ice at the North and South Poles to melt, oceans to rise, and weather to become more extreme — like stronger storms, heatwaves, and wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Animals and people are feeling the changes too. Polar bears are losing their icy homes, farmers are struggling to grow crops in changing climates, and coral reefs are being damaged. But there's good news: we can help!
By saving energy, planting trees, riding bikes instead of cars, and learning about clean energy like wind and solar power, we can all help slow down climate change and protect our planet for the future.

    <h1>Pollution</h1>

    <div id="boxes">
        <p>
Pollution is anything harmful we add to the Earth — and it’s all around us.
There are different kinds of pollution:
Air pollution from cars and factories can make the air dirty and hard to breathe.
Water pollution happens when chemicals or trash get into rivers, lakes, or oceans.
Land pollution comes from littering and piles of garbage that aren’t properly managed.
        </p>
<p>
Pollution doesn't just look bad — it can harm animals, plants, and even people. Fish can get sick from plastic in the ocean. Birds can mistake trash for food. And polluted air can make people cough or feel tired.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, we can help reduce pollution! Simple things like not littering, using less plastic, picking up after ourselves, and using eco-friendly products can make a huge difference. The more we care, the cleaner the Earth becomes.

        <section id="recycling">

    <h1>Recycling</h1>

    <div id="boxes">
<p>
Recycling means turning old stuff into new stuff — and it’s awesome for the planet!
Instead of throwing everything into the trash, we can recycle materials like paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and glass. These items go to special recycling centers where they’re cleaned, melted, or broken down and turned into something brand new.
</p>
<p>
Why is recycling important? It helps us:
</p>
<p>
Use fewer natural resources like trees and minerals
</p>
<p>
Save energy
</p>
<p>
Reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or the ocean
</p>
<p>
Keep our environment cleaner and healthier
</p>
<p>
But recycling only works when we sort things properly! That means knowing what can and can’t be recycled, rinsing dirty containers, and putting things in the right bin. It’s one of the easiest ways for kids to help the Earth — and it’s a habit that makes a big impact.
    </p>

    <section id="sustainableLiving">
    <h1>Sustainable Living</h1>

    <div id="boxes">
        <p>
    Sustainable living is all about making smart choices that are good for the Earth — and for us.
When we live sustainably, we use just what we need and avoid wasting things. That means using less water and electricity, choosing reusable items (like water bottles and shopping bags), eating more locally grown foods, and thinking about how our actions affect the environment.
</p>
<p>
It’s not about being perfect — it’s about being mindful. Every small step counts:
</p>
<p>
Turn off lights when you leave a room
</p>
<p>
Take shorter showers
</p>
<p>
Reuse or repurpose things instead of throwing them away
</p>
<p>
Share, donate, or swap instead of always buying new
</p>
<p>
Sustainable living helps protect our air, water, and land so that future generations can enjoy them too. And the best part? Anyone can do it — starting today!
